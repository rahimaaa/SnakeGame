#Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java.

#How to Play
The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer. If the snake collides with a wall or with its own body, the game ends.

To control the snake, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. The up arrow key moves the snake up, the down arrow key moves the snake down, the left arrow key moves the snake left, and the right arrow key moves the snake right.
